// The sync func below is used to synchronize the code in 'execute'.
// This means that the code is thread safe. By using a generic we
// ensure that the return type of the closure can be (almost) anything.
// By providing a 'throw' statement we ensure that any error occurring
// within the closure can be propagated to the containing scope and 
// handled there. The 'defer' is present in order to provide guarantees
// on deadlock; i.e., we will ALWAYS release any waiting threads when the 
// 'sync' method completes.
